REMEMBER: only test your code!
 |-> don't do it to third-party codes, because that's both the owner's job & you shouldn't test something you can't adapt/change

 |-> Only test one thing(feature) per case!

 |-> Focus on the essence of a test when arranging the Triple A
    \-> leads to lower number of Assertions (expect()), which is le good

 |-> Client & Server side Testing:
  \-> eg: API requests
   (-> DON'T test if the function works as intended
   (-> DO test your client-side reaction to different request responses/errors

   /-> PS: separate server to client test codes
